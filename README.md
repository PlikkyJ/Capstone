and this web page allows you to select what games you want as well as a detailed
description about them and the ability to watch a youtube trailer on each of the
video games that are being sold and at the checkout you will have 2 options ether 
you can pickup the game yourself or request it to be delivered as well as you 
can also request to send us a query of what games you would like us to add to 
our store we love customer feedback
